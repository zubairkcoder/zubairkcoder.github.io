 	<p>I was born and raised in Pune. When I was born me and my parents used to live on rent. And after I pass my primary school we shifted to our new house which was our dream to have one. I completed my 10th grade from Saint Joseph's High School, Khadki. And I took admission for my junior college at Nowrosjee Wadia College, Pune. Now I am studying CSE at Maharashtra Institute of Technology World Peace University, Kothrud.</p>
